(defconst mistty--max-accumulate-delay 0.1
  "Limits how long to spend processing immediately pending output.

When MisTTY calls `accept-process-output', Emacs will read data from the
process as long as there is some already available. If the process keeps
sending data, the whole Emacs process would freeze for that long. This
limit must be kept low or Emacs might become unresponsive when the
process outputs data continuously.")

This limit is applied in addition to

  "Process Output Accumulator.

Use this function as process filter to accumulate and process data
before sending it to its destination filter.

Processors can be added to the accumulator to react to specific terminal
sequences being found in the flow before it gets to the real process
filter. See `mistty--accum-add-processor'

Post-processors can be added to the accumulator to react to changes made
by the real process filter. See
`mistty--accum-add-post-processor'.

Usage example:
  (let ((accum (mistty--make-accumulator #'real-process-filter)))
    (process-set-filter proc accum)
