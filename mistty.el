Shell autosuggestions and `completion-at-point' don't work well

around the point for the object to complete, it'll see the
shell's autosuggestions and think that this is what the user
typed. So if the used typed \"com\" and the shell autosuggestion
is \"complete\", what's shown on the buffer \"com<point>plete\"
and naturally `completion-at-point' auto-completes \"complete\"
not \"com\".

To work around that, MisTTY wraps functions on
`completion-at-point-functions' so that they don't see what's
after the point, while on the terminal region. In the example
above, these wrapped functions only see \"com\" and complete
that.

This does mean that completion doesn't work exactly the same way
as it normally does: it only see what's before the point - but
the resulting behavior is saner.

This doesn't work in MisTTY terminal region, as keystrokes are
sent directly to the terminal and `self-insert-command' is just
not used.

MisTTY detects some long-running commands on its own by tracking

also detects completion in region by tracking

Call this function when you'd like to use long-running command

If ACTIVE evaluates to true, report the long-running command as
active, which inhibits MisTTY's normal operation for the duration
